- need hot reload
    + could use https://www.npmjs.com/package/light-server to hot reload
    + compile only necessary

- typescript

- use config in babel file

- stop using pragmatic since issues are not solved
    -> create a copy called jsx-renderer

- deploy: zeit (server function), heroku, netlify, aws?

- might want to use config to support some extra assets extensions

- find a way to separate bundle, for a single page using a framework. Let's imagine most of our page are purely static html with a little bit of vanillaJs but for a specific page, for example the admin dashboard of the website, we use react. We would need to have a way to load react, only for this dashboard and not for in the other statics pages
