- if api folder empty then problem...

- typescript

- use config in babel file

- ~~stop using pragmatic since issues are not solved~~
    -> PR has been merged so we can now use pragmatic

- deploy: zeit (server function), heroku, netlify, aws?

- might want to use config to support some extra assets extensions

- find a way to separate bundle, for a single page using a framework. Let's imagine most of our page are purely static html with a little bit of vanillaJs but for a specific page, for example the admin dashboard of the website, we use react. We would need to have a way to load react, only for this dashboard and not for in the other statics pages

- imporve hot reload
    + babel faster
    + use parcel server
