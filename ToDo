- link page
- page with multiple values [index].js

- onClick should be included in html as script, this can be done with custom node function in jsx-pragmatic
    + it should as well recognize that it is including a server function, like isomor (maybe later)

- <script> in html should be able to call server function isomor style

- could use https://www.npmjs.com/package/light-server to hot reload
